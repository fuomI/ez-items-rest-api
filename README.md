# EzItems REST API

## Description

This is my third project on Fullstack development course in Laurea UAS.

This is the backend for **EzShoppin'** application, which is a shopping list application. 
The purpose of this REST API is to serve clients data about shopping items (name, price, picture).

I have done user research for **EzShoppin'** application during other course(UX):

## Technologies
- **Node.js**
- **Express**
- **MongoDB**

## Routes

The API has **five** routes, **one** for each operation.

- **'/api/getall' (GET)**
- **'/api/add' (POST)**
- **'/api/:id' (GET)**
- **'/api/update/:id' (PATCH)**
- **'/api/delete/:id' (DELETE)**

## Testing

For testing the API I used **REST Client** -extension in **Visual Studio Code**.

## Demonstration

This application is not published elsewhere, but I created a demonstration video where
I test the API and go through the code:
